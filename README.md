### The goal of this project is to practice testing, but more importantly it is about practicing testing properly. This Testing project is done on the form validation project. 

## Procedures
- Test the following features of one of the form components (you choose which):
- Ensure error messages do not show up when submitting a valid form, and that the onSubmit function is called with the correct email/password.
- Ensure error messages show up when submitting an invalid form, and that the onSubmit function is not called.
- Ensure the error messages update when the user changes the input values after the first submit.
- Swap out the form component that you used for testing with the other form component in the same test file. All your tests should still pass.
